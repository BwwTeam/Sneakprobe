Sneakprobe's Scan official website https://scan.bwwteam.com/#/

Sneakprobe adopts the form of B/C architecture. The client can easily access the scanner through a WEB browser and transmit the data directly to the Web server. In addition, Sneakprobe can also realize cross-platform and cross-device scanning and management, and users can access the scan results through the web anytime and anywhere.

Sneakprobe uses front-end and back-end technologies for development, and uses redis for data caching to reduce the performance and response speed of the web service system. Front-end and back-end technologies can achieve better user experience and interaction and meet user needs for functions.

Sneakprobe uses a plug-in to perform vulnerability scanning. Its main functions are:
Port scanning: Port scanning using TCP, SYN, ICMP, UDP and other protocols
Subdomain name scanning: Dictionary scanning for status codes
Directory scanning: Dictionary scanning for status codes
Weak password blasting: Weak password blasting verification for some commonly used ports
Plug-in scan: Determine the fingerprint and perform a specified POC scan. When the fingerprint scan cannot be performed, a complete POC scan is performed.
